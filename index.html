        <p> Hello, my name is Dominic Varchetto and I'm a senior here at Lewis University. I have 
            created this webpage called Programming 101 to help students who aren't familiar with coding
            and who don't know much. I myself wasn't familiar with coding and I didn't code a day
            in my life before this class. Now I feel like I better understand the world of coding and
            I want to share some information about the different languages learned in this course, but also
            some tips and tricks that I was provided when I begun my journey. I hope you find this 
            webpage useful and helpful as you start your journey into programming. 
        </p>

        </ul>
        
    </div> 

    <div id="HTML" class="tabcontent">
        <h2> What is HTML?</h2>
        <p> HTML is the standard markup language for documents that are designed to be displayed
            in a web browser. It stands for HyperText Markup Language. You will use HTML when creating
            webpages like "Getting to Know Each Other" and "Hello World". It is very important that
            you set the document up correctly when in VS Code. </p>
        <h2> HTML Code Starter: </h2>
        <p> Below is how you should set up your VS Code to have it as an HTML file:</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <picture id="Image">
        <img src="HTMLStart.JPG" alt="Setup Image" style="width:500px">
        </picture>
        <button onclick="toggle(this)">Hide picture</button>
        <p> Make sure to save the file as .HTML</p>

        <h2> Explanation of each line of code: </h2>
        <li> !DOCTYPE HTML - what you want the document to be.  </li>
        <li> HTML lang=en - specifies the language of the elements content. EN = English. </li>
        <li> Meta charset = "UTF-8" - used to specify the character encoding used in an HTML document.
            The HTML5 encourages developers to use the UTF-8 character set which covers almost all
            of the characters and symbols in the world. </li>
        <li> Title - what the web address will be titled</li>
        <li> H1 - heading of the section.</li>
        <li> p - paragraph under the heading.</li>

        <h2> Examples of heading and paragraph</h2>
        <img src="HTMLExplanation.jpg" alt="Example" style="width:500px">
        <img src="HTMLExplanationCode.jpg" alt="Code" style = "width:500px">
    
        <p> As you can see, the first screenshot is of the heading and paragraph. The heading is much
            larger than the paragraph. The second screenshot is the code you would put to make the heading
            and paragraph work. 
        </p>
        <h2> Adding Links / Images</h2>
        <p> Adding links and images is a pretty good idea if you're interested in making a webpage. 
            It is very simple to add links and images into VS Code. Below are screenshots of how to do so. 
        </p>
        <img src="Links-and-images.jpg" alt="Links and Images" style="width:500px">
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="varchetto.jpg" alt="Dominic Picture" style="width:300px">
        <p> Once you type in the image code, this is what will appear. When adding images, make sure
            you're saving it as a .jpg or .png extension. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="https://github.com/">Github </a>
        <p> Once you type in the link code, this is what will appear. You'll be able to click the link 
            and it will direct you to the website where the link was programmed to. 
        </p>

    </div>
   
    <div id="CSS" class="tabcontent">
        <h2> What is CSS?</h2>
        <p> CSS is what makes your website pop. Within CSS, you can change the color of text, change
            the color of the background, align text, and much more. I highly recommend using it 
            to make your webpage pop and pleasing to the eye </p>
        <h2> How to align text and pictures:</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li> Determine where you want your text to be aligned.</li>
            <li> If you want your text centered this is what you should input into HTML or CSS...</li>
            <img src="Text1.jpg" alt="Text Alignment" style="width:500px;">
            <li> This is then what the text should look like on your webpage...</li>
            <img src="text2.jpg" alt="Text Alignment 2" style="width:500px;">
            <li> If you want to center your image, this is what you should input into HTML or CSS...</li>
            <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Image 1" style="width:500px;">
            <li> This is then what your picture should look like on your webpage with it centered...</li>
            <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Image 2" style="width:500px;">
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2> Looking to add color?</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li> There are a bunch of different colors you can use in CSS. You can even make your own
                color. </li>
            <li> This is what you should input into CSS if you would like color to your text: </li>
            <img src="color1.jpg" alt="Color Code" style="width:500px;">
            <li> This is what the text should look like once you implemented the color</li>
            <br>
            <img src="color2.jpg" alt="Color Text" style="width:500px;">
        </ul>
    
        <h2> Font Style / Font Family:</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
            <li> As you can see in the screenshots above, all you need to do is type font-size and 
                font-family into your code and it will change it for you. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Adding lists and bullet points:</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
            <li> If I wanted to put bullet points as squares, I would type this in VS Code...</li>
            <img src="lists1.jpg" alt="Bullet Points" style="width:500px;">
            <li> The final product then should like this....</li>
            <img src="lists2.jpg" alt="Bullet Points2" style="width:500px;">
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="Java" class="tabcontent">
        <h2> What is JavaScript?</h2>
        <p> JavaScript which is often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of 
            the core technologies of the world wide web, alongside that of HTML and CSS. Note that 
            Java and JavaScript are completely different languages. </p>

        <h2> Examples of JavaScript and how it works:</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
             <li> As mentioned, JavaScript can make your website pop.</li>
            <li> Want to change the color of your text from a click of a button? JavaScript allows
                you to do that. Here is what you would type into VS code...</li>
            <img src="JavaScript1,jpg.JPG" alt="Java Script" width="500px;">
            <li> Once you have input it into VS code, the color should change from this...</li>
            <img src="javascript2.jpg" alt="Java Script2" width="500px;">
            <li> To this...</li>
            <img src="javascript3.jpg" alt="Java Script3" width="500px;">
            </ul>
        <h2> JavaScript if, else, and else if statements:</h2>
            <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
            <li> You use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true.</li>
            <li> You use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false.</li>
            <li> You use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is fale.</li>
            <li> Here is an example from Matchmaker for the Web using if, else, and else if statements... </li>
            <img src="IfElseElseIfStatement.jpg" alt="Statements" width="500px;">
            <li> As you can see, this is using the if, else, and else if statement. If you get below 
                a 50% score, a certain message will pop up. If you get a score between 50 - 75%,
                another message will pop up. Then, if you get a message anything over 75%, a different
                message will pop up.</li>
            <li> These statements are super important to use for a lot of webpage and application
                development.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="Python" class="tabcontent">
        <h2> What is Python?</h2>
        <p> Python is used in a number of different development ways. It's one of the more popular
            programming languages people use around the world. Programmers fall in love with Python
            because of the increased productivity it provides. It also can be used on a server to
            create web applications.</p>
        <h2> Example of python via TurtleDraw</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
            <li> Turtle Draw is a very good example of Python at work...</li>
            <li> To get started, you must make sure you import turtle. To do so, all you type in is 
                import turtle like so...</li>
            <img src="turtle1.jpg" alt="Turtle" width="500px;">
            <li> Once you have that implemented, it is easy from there.</li>
            <li> Make sure to have a text file saved with the coordinates of where you want the pen to
                go and also make sure that you let the pen know when to go up and down. The commands
                are below...</li>
            <img src="turtle2.jpg" alt="Turtle2" width="500px;">
            <li> This is how you should set it up after you import turtle. This doesn't have to be
                exact, but something similar. Make sure you tell the file to open the text file as 
                read only and to have it read line for line. </li>
            <li> There are a lot more examples that have to do with Python, and Turtle Draw is one</li>
        </ul>
