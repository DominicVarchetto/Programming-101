# Programming-101
Programming 101 is for my final project. I created Programming 101 to help those who are new to
programming, like myself, and I just wanted to give them some information regarding some of the languages
that we used and also some examples of what each language does. This project was inspired by another final
project, HTML Cheatsheet. I hope you guys enjoy! 

## Next Update
Next features I would add would be to add more languages and talk about them and give examples using them.
In addition, I would want to make my webpage more neat and organized. There are a lot of pictures all
over the place and I think it would look a lot neater if I could hide all of the images like I did to
one.
