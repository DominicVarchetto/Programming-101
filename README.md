# Programming-101
Programming 101 is for my final project. I created Programming 101 to help those who are new to
programming, like myself, and I just wanted to give them some information regarding some of the languages
that we used and also some examples of what each language does. This project was inspired by another final
project, HTML Cheatsheet. I hope you guys enjoy!
